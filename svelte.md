# üè∫ Svelte

## What Is It?

Svelte is a reactive UI toolkit. It's a ESM library package that helps us create UI packages that are re-usable.

UI created with Svelte is reactive, meaning that it only updates the browser DOM whenever a variable changes, instead of every frame like Canvas or WebGL.

## What Are The Benefits?

* **Simplicity** - .svelte files have easy to follow syntax compared to alternatives.
* **Speed** - .svelte scripts build out to HTML/CSS/JS files, giving native performance
* **Community** - Svelte regularly tops developer feedback surveys and is widely supported
* **Integration** - Svelte supports Vite and Typescript out of the box

## Installation Guide

* Open Visual Studio Code
* Open the terminal and run `pnpm create vite`
* Name your project, and choose Svelte & Typescript as your UI and scripting language
* Run the `pnpm run dev` command to test your project

## Learning Svelte

We recommend going through the [official Svelte tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics). It's quite long, but it covers everything on how to write .svelte files and is directly accessible within your web browser.
