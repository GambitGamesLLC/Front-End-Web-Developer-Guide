# ðŸ“¦ ESM

## What Is It?

ES6 modules (shortened to 'ESM') are the standard way of writing and reading code as a package module. It replaces older standards such as IIFE and CommonJS used in older websites and is officially supported in all modern web browsers.&#x20;

## What Are The Benefits?

* Packaging and distributing discrete bundles of code allows for re-use.
* An actual app using various modules needs far less code, simplifying codebases
* Modifying a package allows for apps and other packages to take advantage of those updates easily in a standard way.

## Why Not Use IIFE Or CommonJS?

* IIFE helps prevent polluting the window object in javascript with variables, but script name clashes can still occur.
* CommonJS is the unofficial standard for modules created before ESM existed. It still works but is deprecated as ESM is built into modern web browsers.

## How Do I Use ESM?

Take a look at the example code for a script we want to export

```
//Inside a file named MyFile.ts

//Supported in JS or TS
export let myVariable : string = "sup";

//Notice the 'export' keyword
export function MyFunction( message: string ) : void
{
    console.log( message );
}
```

Now let's look at the code for another script that wants to import the code we wrote previously

```
//Inside Importer.ts

import {myVariable, MyFunction} from "./MyFile.ts";

MyFunction( myVariable ); //Will print 'sup' to the console
```

Alternatively, we could import the original script as a complete object

```
//Inside Importer.ts

import * as MyFile from "./MyFile.ts";

MyFile.MyFunction( MyFile.myVariable ); //Will print 'sup' to the console
```

And we can also import dynamically

```
//Inside Importer.ts

let MyFile : Any = null;

//Async function can have execution paused
async function Run()
{
    try
    {
        //Pause execution until we retrieve file
        MyFile = await import( "./MyFile.ts" );
    }
    catch( error )
    {
        //Print error if retrieval fails
        console.log( error );
    }
}

//Imports 'MyFile', waits until import completes
Run();

//If we successfully retrieved file, use it!
if( MyFile !== null )
{
    MyFile.MyFunction( MyFile.myVariable ); //Will print 'sup' to the console
}
```

Some other things to keep in mind...

* We don't normally use dynamic imports, as they break tree-shaking during builds and can create un-optimized code.
* We don't commonly use the 'default' keyword. It has limited use-cases.
